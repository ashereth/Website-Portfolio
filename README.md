# Portfolio
A portfolio of websites that I have developed made using html, css, and flask from the Udemy course \
'Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023' by Jose Salvatierra. \
Here is the [link](https://portfolio-9juf.onrender.com) to the deployed website. \
It can take a while to load due to the deployment service that I used
so don't worry if it seems to not be loading for a bit.
