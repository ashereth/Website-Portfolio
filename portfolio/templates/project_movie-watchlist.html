                        This is a movie watchlist website developed through the course 'Web Developer 
                        Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023' by Jose Salvatierra. The website
                        is complete with user registration and login. It allows users to add movies to
                        a watchlist and once the movies have been added the user is able to rate the movie,
                        give it a description, list genres, list the cast, give a hyperlink to the youtube
                        trailer, ect. This was the final project for this Udemy course and it did a good job
                        incorperating everything that I learned throughout the course. I am excited to 
                        work on personal projects and put these newly learned skills to use.
