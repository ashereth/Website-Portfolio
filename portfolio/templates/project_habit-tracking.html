                        This is a simple website built through the course 'Web Developer 
                        Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023' by Jose Salvatierra, that allows the user to create a list of 
                        habits that they want to do on a day to day basis. The user is able to click
                        on the created habits to mark them as done for the day. All of the habits as well
                        as whether or not they are completed for each day are stored in a MongoDB 
                        database so that they will be accessable next time you access the page even
                        if you access it from a different device.
